# SampleAppServer
Sample Application server to avoid CORS issues with BlockChain API 

### Due to the CORS issues with calling the BlockChain API directly you can use this server and expand by adding simpler routes to it 
### Get History of a particular product is added as an example 
#### /GetHistory/:gtin/:serialNumber/:lotNumber/:expiryDate
### Please feel free to expand and add more routes or let us know we will add them
